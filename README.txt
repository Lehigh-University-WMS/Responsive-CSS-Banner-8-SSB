Background:
With the ever growing use of mobile devices, we needed Self Service Banner to be more mobile friendly.  Every app development company, including Ellucian, was tackling this by pulling data out of Banner and displaying it in a clean mobile friendly way.  We chose a different approach.  We made a very minimal change to Self Service Banner in order to leverage capabilities within CSS. Like most institutions, we are very careful about modding anything with baseline. This change is minimal as far as upkeep, but far reaching in terms of enhancing the product.  It is our hope that Ellucian will work to add these changes into the baseline product, but until then, we will continue to share the work that we've done.
